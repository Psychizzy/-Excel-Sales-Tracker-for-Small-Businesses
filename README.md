## 📌 Project Overview
This project was inspired by a real-world scenario where a small business owner reached out on Twitter asking for help to better understand her sales, profit, expenses, and inventory using **Excel only**.

The goal was to build a **simple, automated, and non-technical sales tracker** that allows business owners to focus on decisions — not formulas or dashboards maintenance.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Many small business owners:
- Record sales manually
- Do not clearly know their actual profit
- Cannot track which products perform best
- Run out of stock unexpectedly
- Find tools like Power BI too complex or inaccessible

They need **clarity**, **simplicity**, and **control** — all in one place.

### 📋 Data Entry Sheets
- **Sales Sheet** – daily sales entry

### ⚙️ Automated Calculations
- Sales, Cost, and Profit calculated automatically
